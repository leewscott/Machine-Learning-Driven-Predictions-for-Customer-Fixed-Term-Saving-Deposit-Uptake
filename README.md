# Machine-Learning-Driven-Predictions-for-Customer-Fixed-Term-Saving-Deposit-Uptake
Built predictive models using Scikit-Learn to classify if a customer would make a fixed-term saving deposit using bank marketing data from the UCI ML Repository. Performed an EDA, addressed class imbalances, engineered features and developed a pipeline to prepare for training. Trained and fine-tuned three different models using grid search and cross validation (macro average F1-score of 0.73 on test set for best performing model).
